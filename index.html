    <p>
      Golden Retrievers are beautiful, smart, and loyal dogs. They are one of
      the most saught after breeds in the world for obvious reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldens are naturally inclined to please people and therefore make great
      companion and service dogs. They are equally great at learning
      working-skills as they are cuddled up in your lap at home.
